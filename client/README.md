# Instructions to start client-side

## Description
The client-side here was built with React(Router) and used to communicate with the server (as hosted on PORT 8000). The client-side, like most React applicatoins, is hosted on port 3000. The client-side communicates with the backend server through using the axios library for making CRUD calls to the backend.

## Instructions
To begin, install the dependencies with running ``npm install`` and, then, as like most React programs, start the client-side with ``npm start`` and it should open a new tab in your browser to a Welcome page that suggests the current client to login, signup, or continue as a guest.
