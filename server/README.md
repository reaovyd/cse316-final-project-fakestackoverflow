# Instructions To Start Server

## Getting started
To get started, please run ``npm install`` to install the required dependencies.

## dotEnv
The backend here requires the use of the node package ``dotEnv`` to store environment variables, but the ``.env`` file is not committed for obvious reasons. 

The person using this backend must create their own ``.env`` file like so:
```
touch .env
```

## Starting the server
Note that the server is hosted on port ``8000``. To get the server running, you can run ``npm run start`` or ``node server.js``.
